Yesterday I posted a video on [Twitter](https://x.com/hot_town/status/1863553258586820976) and on [Reddit’s r/sideproject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1h4t8vk/my_saas_only_makes_550_a_month_and_i_think_thats/) expressing my opinion that I think super simple SaaS apps that only make a small amount of side income should be your goal when starting out.

And the response was overwhelmingly positive.

Let me explain what I mean in more detail: 

**I often think that developers trying their shot at building a side project take it too seriously**. Yep, you read that right.

They should think of their side project as an experiment, not a business.

Because in the early stages, that’s what it is. It’s just a test to see if people are willing to pay for a (software) product that you offer them.

So instead of following all the “rules” around building a profitable SaaS, you should be breaking some of them. 

Here are some examples of what I mean:

- Forget a shiny landing page, just take your user straight to your product and let them try it out, if possible.
- Keep your initial product as simple as possible. Make it easy for the user to comprehend and get started with.
- Don’t spend more than a month building it.
- It doesn’t matter if it’s ugly, you can improve it later.
- Use the tools that help you build the fastest, not the ones that others tell you you should be using.

These tactics are exactly what I used to build and launch [CoverLetterGPT](https://coverlettergpt.xyz) and get it to ~$550 monthly recurring revenue (MRR) after a year.

It doesn’t have a landing page.

It’s not optimized for SEO.

I built it in about a week.

The UI is… not the prettiest.

It’s a .xyz domain (not .com or .ai).

And I do little to no maintenance on the app, nor do I have to deal with customer service.

And I love it and will probably be keeping it that way.

By the way, here’s my favorite tech stack that I used to build it, but you should use whatever helps you build & launch fast:

- Framework: [https://wasp-lang.dev](https://wasp-lang.dev/)
  - TIP! Use their [free, open-source SaaS template](https://opensaas.sh) to build even faster
- UI Components: https://www.chakra-ui.com/
- Deployed to Railway: https://railway.app/ & Netlify: https://netlify.com/
- Costs ~$15/month to run including OpenAI API fees

In my opinion, it’s all about tradeoffs. 

Personally, I’m lazy, so I want maximum reward for minimal effort. That means I don’t want to spend a lot of my free time maintaining apps I’ve already built (to be honest, I’m a lot like most developers and I like to try out and work on lots of new ideas, rather than focus a lot of energy on stale ones).

So, for me, $550 MRR is amazing! It’s enough side income for me because It’s an app that basically runs on auto-pilot next to my full-time job, that I don’t have to worry about.

If you’ve been thinking about building a SaaS app for a while, but haven’t taken the plunge, remember this: it’s just an experiment.
